            with elements of prog-pop,
            psychedelic pop, folk, soul, funk and indie pop.

            Walls is the debut studio album by English singer and songwriter
            Louis Tomlinson, released on 31 January 2020 through Syco music and
            Arista Records. In making the album, Tomlinson stated he had spent
            "so long on this album" as he "couldn't help but crave a 'hit' single" after a
            career of "straight down the middle pop". In an interview with Billboard,
            Tomlinson said that the album is him "just wearing heart on his sleeve, and
            being honest, reflecting on a breakup", and that "once fans have heard the
            album, they will see a slightly different side" of him.
